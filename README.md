# fredcoin

fredcoin is a simple fungible token implemented as a Clarity smart contract and managed with [Clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet).

## Prerequisites

- [Clarinet](https://docs.hiro.so/clarinet) (version 3.10.0 or later)
- Node.js and npm (optional, for running TypeScript tests)

## Project structure

- `Clarinet.toml` – Clarinet project configuration
- `contracts/fredcoin.clar` – fredcoin token smart contract
- `tests/fredcoin.test.ts` – sample test file (generated by Clarinet)
- `settings/` – network configuration files

## Contract overview

The `fredcoin` contract defines a basic fungible token:

- `fredcoin` fungible token via `define-fungible-token`
- Admin (initially the deployer) stored in `token-admin`
- Total supply tracked by the Clarinet/Clarity runtime

### Key functions

Read-only:
- `get-admin` – returns the current admin principal
- `get-balance (owner)` – returns the balance of `owner`
- `get-total-supply` – returns the total supply of fredcoin

Public:
- `set-admin (new-admin)` – can only be called by the current admin to transfer admin rights
- `mint (recipient amount)` – admin-only minting of new tokens to `recipient`
- `transfer (amount sender recipient)` – transfers tokens from `sender` to `recipient`

## Usage

From the project root:

### Check contracts

```bash path=null start=null
clarinet check
```

### (Optional) Run tests

Install dependencies and run tests:

```bash path=null start=null
npm install
npm test
```

## Development notes

- The initial admin is the contract deployer (the principal in `tx-sender` when the contract is instantiated).
- Only the admin can call `mint` and `set-admin`.
- `transfer` validates that `sender` has enough balance before transferring.
